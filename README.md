# GJRT_Jam1
This is our project repository for the first Game Jam Research Team jam project.  May this be the first of many.

Added webhooks to our Discord.  It's important to append /github to the end of the generated hook, and change to application/json.

## Instructions for testing the project
Clone repository, and select the root folder from Unity Hub to open a new project.  The first time you do this, Unity will need to populate a few things that were left out by the .gitignore file.  This may take a few minutes. 

Once in the editor, navigate to the "Main Menu" scene.  Drag and drop the Level Loader scene into the hierarchy, then right click it and select "Unload Scene."  The level selection screen will handle loading the appropriate scene. 

Currently, you can select a level, then move the camera around using arrow keys.
